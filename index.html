					<section class="content-description">
						The nice thing about beginning hiking is that you don’t really need
						any special gear, you can probably get away with things you already
						have. Let’s start with clothing. A typical mistake hiking beginners
						make is wearing jeans and regular clothes, which will get heavy and
						chafe wif they get sweaty or wet.

						To start, print out the hiking guide and map. If it’s raining, throw
						them in a Zip-Lock bag. Read over the guide, study the map, and have
						a good idea of what to expect. I like to know what my next landmark
						is as I hike. For example, I’ll read the guide and know that say, in
						a mile, I make a right turn at the junction..
